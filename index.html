            <h3>Hi!  My name is Devon; thank you so much for visiting my site.  Have you found yourself searching for a recipe, found one that looks promsing and then had to scroll through an absurb amount of text to find the ingredients and instructions?  This has happened to me one too many times, and I decided to create a space with no extra fluff, just the details you need.  Welcome to a hub of delicious vegan meals, where you will never have to ask "Where's the Recipe?"</h3>
